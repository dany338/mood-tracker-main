## Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

I chose to use Node.js for the API due to its efficiency in handling asynchronous operations and its compatibility with microservices architecture. For the frontend, I opted for React because of its ability to build dynamic user interfaces and its seamless integration with animation libraries.

## How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

Total: 8 hours
- Learning Framework: 2 hours
- Coding: 4 hours
- Debugging: 2 hours

## If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

Ensure to meticulously plan the API structure and state management in the frontend before starting to code. This will save time and reduce the need for refactoring later on.

## Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

Yes, this assignment allowed me to demonstrate my full stack development skills, especially in integrating an API with a frontend application and managing Docker containers.

## Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?

Although not demonstrated in this exercise, I have experience in implementing automated tests and using CI/CD tools to ensure the quality and efficiency of code deployment.
