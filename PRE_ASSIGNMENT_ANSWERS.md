# Pre Assignment

## What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

The integration of the API with the frontend application may present risks, especially in terms of ensuring proper data persistence and retrieval. Additionally, configuring and deploying Docker containers should be handled carefully to avoid compatibility and performance issues.

## What changes/additions would you make to the design?

I would implement an authentication system to differentiate between users and protect personal data. Additionally, I would add a filtering functionality so that users can view their mood states within a specific date range, thus enhancing the user experience.

## List two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- Integration with charts and visualizations so that users can see trends and patterns in their mood over time.
- Personalized notifications and reminders for users to regularly log their mood.
- A sentiment analysis component that provides insights into possible factors influencing mood changes.

## Are there any clarifying questions you would ask? If you're able to make assumptions about these and continue, please record and share your assumptions.

I would ask if there are any preferences for specific tools or technologies for the API implementation, besides Node.js and Python. I will assume there are no restrictions and that I can use the tools and technologies I am most comfortable with, as long as they meet the project requirements.
